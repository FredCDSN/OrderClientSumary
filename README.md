This is a program that I made for a restaurant to generate the sumary of a order. 

HOW IT WORKS:
1# Enter the Client Data in this order: Name -> Email -> Birth Date .
2# Enter the Order Data in this order: Status(Pending_Payment, Processing, Shipped, Delivered) -> Quantity of items.
3# Enter the Item Data in this order:  Name -> Price -> Quantity.

After those steps, the program gives you a order Sumary containing the Order moment(DD/MM/YYYY - HH : mm : ss ), Order Status, Client data(Name - Birth Date - Email) , Order Items(Name - Price - Quantity - Subtotal-price(OrderQuantity * OrderPrice)) and Total Order price.

HOW TO USE IT : 
1# Click on the green Code button of the repository -> select HTTPS -> copy the link.
2# Open the Git Bash on the folder you want to clone the program.
3# Type: git clone -https copied link- 
4# Type: code .
